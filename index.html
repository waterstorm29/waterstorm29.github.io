	<h2>What I'm currently occupied with:</h2>
	<em><p id="subtitleInt">An essay about the SMART method of setting objectives</p></em>
	<p><strong>Introduction</strong>. I can’t help but notice the sheer success of the proliferation of the SMART mnemonic that continues to be used in essentially all of the institutions that I have come across. It really is a testament to the efficacy of the technique. In this journal log, I shall be transcribing the goals I already have in mind, and I will explain how I will and have already been adapting this technique.
My objectives. Throughout the years that I have been a full-time student, and continue to be a full-time student, my life has been nothing more than the quest for earning as much knowledge and skill before I am forced into the industry to support myself and those around me financially. It has therefore been crucial for me to be efficient in setting goals and achieving them in a timely and effective manner. Having specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and time-bound goals is fundamental to setting any objective that is plausible and will benefit you, rather than disappoint you in the end of the endeavor for setting goals farther than what is physically possible. Most of the objectives that I have set is, perhaps, predictably about learning and earning academic achievements. That is, until now that I realize college is something more than just seeking validation from different academic institutions—it is the place, time, and climax of our mental development. I am aware, however, that it won’t be the end, as mental development is a life-long process, but I digress. Some of what I have in mind are enumerated thus:</p>
		<ol>
<li>1.	Improving my academic life’s status quo by keeping up with my tasks</li><br>
<li>2.	Learning computer-science-related topics and enhancing my skills with the same</li><br>
	<ol>
		<li>a.	Web development</li><br>
		<li>b.	Game development</li><br>
		<li>c.	3D Modeling</li><br>
	</ol>
<li>3.	Learning the German language</li><br>
<li>4.	Increasing the musical pieces that I can play on guitar and violin</li><br>
			</ol>
<p>My list may be either over- or under-whelming for different people, but for me, I find that it is sufficiently invigorating and predictably fulfilling to be able to finish all of these tasks. Moreover, it doesn’t sound unrealistic, as the time-frame is fairly long for a couple of things to fit inside. I have already established what exactly my goals are, but they can also be narrowed down to the extents that I will be pursuing these goals individually. Although, before that, I would like to shed a bit of light on what I have already achieved with these endeavors.</p>
<p><strong>My existing progress</strong>. To be frank, my real list might be slightly longer than what I included here as I intend to be a holistically developed person at the end of my youthful years—before entering the industry that I chose as I enrolled myself to this program in the university. In any case, the progress I have made with the first item in this list, i.e., my academic life, is not of the best excellence among all those in this enumeration. By the end of these 12 months, I envision myself to be substantially more responsible with the tasks I regularly have to finish. This shall be an essential skill in any workplace. Secondly, developing computer skills, especially in the field of computer science and information technology, is crucial to becoming employable. I am already acquainted and aptly skilled in HTML, CSS, Python, and even AHK, but I also seek to learn JavaScript and its frameworks, specifically the full-stack of MEAN. Game development isn’t very high in my priorities, but I am already familiar with the user interface of Unity—a game development engine. For that, I will also have to learn C#. 3D modeling is also an applicable skill in the media and film industries, which I am quite interested in. I have indulged myself in filmmaking since I was 10 with the use of advanced software and equipment that I borrow from my brother who is a professional in the bailiwick. My objective is to be capable of using the software without any tutorial videos guiding me, and be capable of making anything that I think of up to a recognizable level—particularly architecture and environment art. (I’ve made significant progress with modeling as well, for I continuously enroll in various relevant training programs.) Lastly, my musical aptitude. I consider myself an intermediate player of the guitar, capable of advanced riffs, solos, and fingerstyle compositions. I hope to continue my improvement with more fingerstyle compositions. It would be the same with the violin, but I’m less competent with that instrument as I’m a beginner.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>. I will strive to achieve the above goals to the best of my ability, but will also keep in mind that the only constant thing in the world is change. Therefore, I will act according to the drifts of the tide, but will generally follow the guidelines I set for myself.
